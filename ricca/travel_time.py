#      LIBRARY EXPLANATIONS

# 1) heapify of a list: rearranges the elements within the list s.t. the list satisfies the heap property.

# 2) heappush(heap, element): function that adds an element to the heap while maintaining the heap invariant.

# 3) heappop(heap): function that removes and returns the smallest element from the heap. Reorganizes the heap
#                 to maintain the heap property after removing the smallest element.
